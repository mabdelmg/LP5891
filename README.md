Overview

This project demonstrates communication between a microcontroller acting as an SPI slave and a matrix LED display. 
The communication involves sending data frames using SPI, generating a clock signal with a timer 
(where the timer pin is connected to the SPI CLK pin), and utilizing a GPIO pin to trigger the Chip Select (CS) pin.

Requirements

Microcontroller with SPI, Timer, and GPIO capabilities.
Matrix LED display compatible with SPI communication.

Setup

Connect the microcontroller to the matrix LED display.
Ensure proper wiring of SPI (MISO, MOSI, and Timer pin connected to SPI CLK) and connect a GPIO pin for CS.
Set up the development environment with the required toolchain.
